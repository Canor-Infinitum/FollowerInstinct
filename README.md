# Follow™-Frameworks - A Quantum Gravity Engine

This project is part of the **Canor Infinitum FOSS Projects** and is licensed under the **GNU AGPL v3.0-or-later**.

## Ecosystem Integration

FollowerInstinct™ provides the operational scaffolding and quantum sensing library for the **CanorOS** vibe-coding ecosystem. It implements the "Theory of Everything is Now" (Ω-driven events + ECC validation + PID temporal geometry), acting as the runtime coordinator that translates physical sensor streams into active TST/BBST volumetric spaces.

## Why?

We're trying to unite the **Theory of Relativity** with as many **Quantum Gravity** models as possible in a ** *neat* packaging** which is *visually impressive*.

## How?

- **`ATOM`**: A structured `{ Core: REAL[], Interval: (REAL, REAL)[], Base: TENSOR[], OP: Operator }`, for arbitrary SYMBOLIC tensors and operators.
- **`NODE`**: A TST node containing **strictly ordered** PRE/PERI/POST leaves and a relative **`ORIGO`** (Quaternionic-Minkowski spacetime-interval delta) to its parent.
- **`LEAF`**: Contains a kd-mapped `BBST` of `ATOMs` interpreted as:
	- **PRE**: ATOMIC-CONSTRAINTS → BBST of ATOMs applied to `ORIGO-Interval` to yield a *3D-OBJECT*,
	- **PERI**: ATOMIC-VALUES → BBST of ATOMs enrich *3D-OBJECT* into *VOLUMETRIC-OBJECT*,
	- **POST**: ATOMIC-FREEDOMS → BBST of ATOMs add temporal structure to produce *ANIMATED-OBJECT*.

See `AGENTS.md` for more implementation-specific information.

## What?

Contains the following:
 - *`/data/`*: Place your AdvancedLIGO & JWST Datasets here.
 - *`/follow/`*: Use the included Follow™-Frameworks which is a direct implementation of the Quantum Gravity Engine with the default QG Model and the default ToE Theory.
 - *`/output/`*: The Output-files are located in this directory.
 - *`/src/`*: The Quantum Gravity Engine Source-code is located in this directory.
 - *`/target/`*: .git-ignore folder (Rust-Specific Target/Debug/Binaries-directory)

# Operational Scaffolding

## Default QG: "Diffeomorphic Quantum Gravity"

#### *An in-house Quantum Gravity Model.*

Each **Atom** is at least a Quaternionic-Minkowski Spacetime-Interval.
These Quaternions are equivalent to a Lorentz-Boosted Spacetime-Interval.

Using a **Ternary Search Tree** (TST), together with *Minkowski Spacetime Origo-deltas per edge*; with strict ordering of *Pre*-/*Peri*-/*Post*-leaves containing kd-mapped **Balanced Binary Search Trees** (BBST) of Atoms, the following process is applied:

 1. **Pre-Node Constraints**:
	- The Pre-Node's BBST contents are processed as Constraints into a new Lorentzian Frame.
	- The result is a kd-mapped BBST with Lorentz-Boosted edges from the **Node's Origo**
 2. **Peri-Node Values**:
	- The Peri-Node's BBST contents are processed as Spatial Values; each Lorentzian Frame is given a Topological Structure.
	- The result is the former BBST-result now with additional **Geometric Data**.
 3. **Post-Node Freedoms**:
	- The Post-Node's BBST contents are prcessed as Temporal Values; each now-geometric excitations is given a Warmup-/Cooldown-Period, resulting in Animated Volumetric Renders.
	- The result is the former BBST-result, now functioning as a **Temporally Animated Relativistic Geometry**.

## Default ToE: "Theory of Everything is Now"

#### *A Computable Fractal-Universe - Theory of Everything.*

The universe is a *computable*, *self-correcting fractal* rendered from *ECC‑validated quantum events*, where spacetime coordinates are generated by online approximations of *quantum‑gravitational **Ω‑numbers**;* universal “time” is a control geometry synthesized by a PID‑like law over *update/error functionals*, and the visualizable world is the *volumetric accumulation of these events*.

	Using Error-Correcting Code-Based Quantum Events, wherein each Minkowski Spacetime-position is the result of Approximation of Quantum Gravitational Omega Numbers, the Temporal Values of which are asserted functioning like an elaborate PID-Loop, results in a Omega Program of which computes a "Timeless" Lorentzian Frame-Substitute (Temporal Values approximating a Temporal Geometric Structure), the Spatial Variables of which is our Volumetric Spacetime-Render.

#### *Mathematics & Computability: Ω‑driven events + ECC*
1. Omega numbers in physics (operationalized)
	- Let Ω_G be a Quantum‑Gravitational Chaitin‑Omega: the halting probability over a universal prefix quantum‑gravitational machine U_G with a domain restricted by physical computability (finite memory/time, energy). We never know Ω_G, but we can compute prefix approximations Ω_G(n) ↑ (n=1,2,… ) as lower semicomputable reals (monotone increasing sequences).
	- Each approximation step induces a delta δn = Ω_G(n) ⊖ Ω_G(n−1) (u8-quantized), which seeds quantum events.
2. ECC‑based quantum events
	- Each δn is encoded into codewords c_n of a fixed error‑correcting code C (e.g., a linear block code).
	- Readouts from the “vacuum” (measurement attempts) return noisy symbols ~c_n​.
		Physical acceptance happens iff decoding succeeds:
		`Decode(~c_n) → c_n (within t errors);`
	- Accepted events are computationally valid; rejected ones are discarded as gauge/noise.
		This makes quantum events computable (ECC-valid) while tolerating stochasticity.
3. Spacetime as a computable fractal measure:
	- Map each accepted c_n​ to u8 intervals for (t,x,y,z) and define:
		- Temporal control variable T_n​ := Update_n / Error_n​​​ (PID-like; both are u8‑interval functionals),
		- Spatial write: a splat into a voxel grid (u8 intervals) with multiresolution refinement (octree).
		- The sequence of accepted writes W_n​ forms an iterated function system (IFS) with interval‑valued contractions; over time this yields a fractal‑like measure on the 3+1 grid.

# Diffeomorphic Quantum Gravity

Axiome: Quantum Gravity demands generalizations of the Lorentz Factor for establishment of Quantum Entanglement as the basis Universal Operator required to describe Quantum Phenomena.

Conjecture: No amount of Symbolic Regression can prove Quantum Gravity for any singular Inertial Frame; one requires at least two (inertial or comoving) Frames, as Quantum Entanglement is the basis operator that drives Quantum Phenomena.

Paradox: No amount of Multi-Variate Calculus can solve for more than one variable simultaneously throughout all of symbolic regression, arising simply due to the definitions.

Diffeomorphic Quantum Gravity Theory: Asserting Infinitely Recursive Differentiation of (for example infinite tetrations of) the Imaginary Bases (as a Diffeomorphic Solution to the Poincaré Conjecture) as in-the-limit being equivalent to arithmetics of (at least) two trigonometric functions of two (or more) variables, enables excitations within two (or more) frames to have a Diffeomorphic Coupling, dependent on Lorentz-Transformations between the frames, which equals Gravitational Entanglement written in terms of equations involving di, dj and dk.

Quantum Interpretation: Generalizations to the Diffeomorphic Solution involving arithmetics of N-dimensional trigonometric functions of n-variables describing all Quantum Phenomena in the entire Quantum Universe.

Quantum Gravity Communication: Using this model as Model of Unification of all other Quantum Gravity models, enables Quantum Gravity Communication Frameworks and Protocols.

Quantum-Relativity Postulate: Using Interval Arithmetic for a Quantum Uncertainty-embedded value {val: v, low: v_0, high: v_1} and storing the absolute value `sqrt((e^(val-low))² + (-e^(val-high))²)` as the norm of their intersection for usage in e.g., tensorizations of Lorentzian-gamma, is a novel relativity extension into Unruh-DeWitt Lorentzian Frames and complexified gamma.
